<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi, I'm Narges! I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at<br />
  Kharazmi University. My passion for technology and problem-solving keeps me<br />
  motivated as I dive deeper into the world of coding and algorithms.<br />
  I thrive on challenges and work best under pressure—it helps me stay focused<br />
  and productive.When I'm not studying, you can find me riding my bicycle or<br />
  binge-watching my favorite series. I'm also a huge fan of music—Harry Styles'<br />
  songs always make my day, and I’m equally obsessed with Halsey’s unique style.
