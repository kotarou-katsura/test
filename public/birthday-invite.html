  - Today is such a special day, you know?<br />
  + Oh my gosh! Wait... it's your birthday, isn't it?<br />
  - Yay! You remembered! That makes me so happy!<br />
  + Of course, I did! How could I forget? So, how are we celebrating? ðŸŽ‰

<h2>Don't Forget to Bring These Things:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>A gift (even if it's just your dazzling personality).</li>
  <li>A cake (or at least a really good excuse for not bringing one).</li>
  <li>Your friends (yes, they count as party props).</li>
  <li>Your appetite (because who skips cake?).</li>
  <li>Your dance moves (even if they are just awkward head bobs).</li>
  <li>A sense of humor (essential for surviving party games).</li>
  <li>Confetti (or random paper scrapsâ€”it is the effort that counts).</li>
  <li>A playlist (unless you trust my questionable taste in music).</li>
  <li>Good vibes only (strictly no bad mood allowed!).</li>
  <li>A camera (to capture the chaos for blackmail later).</li>
</ol>
